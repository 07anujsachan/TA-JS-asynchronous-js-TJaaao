## XMLHttpRequest + Promise

- Create a fucntion named `fetch` which can accept one parameter an `url` and returns a promise.
- Use `XMLHttpRequest` to make a network request.
- When the data is loaded resolve the promise
- If there is any issue loading data reject the promise
- When the promise is resolved we can access the information coming from the URL.

- Refactor the image search app you created (in previous exercise) to use the function `fetch` you crated above.
