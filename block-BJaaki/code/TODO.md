# SubReddit Clone

We are going to create a clone of a sub reddit page of your choice:-

- Go to [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript)
- Similarly pick any sub-reddit of your choice.
- To get the data of the page as API you just need to add `.json` at the end of URL like `https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript.json`
- The data on the particular page will be provided to you by this API
- Use the API and create a clone of the page.
- You will use `fetch` browser API for getting data.
- Handle if the user is offline using `navigator.onLine` (Inform user with appropiate message)
- Handle if there is some error fetching data. (Show relevent message in UI)
